# Excel Dashboard: Bank Loan Data Overview

I applied a bank loan dataset consisting of 38,576 records and 25 features to develop two dashboards. A one dashboard reveals a summary of the loan information such as good and bad loans, the amount funded and repayment. The other dashboard gives an overview, showing trends such as loan applications by month, purpose, state, term and employment length. These dashboards allow easy visualization of how loans are performing and customer trends in an easy to interpret manner.
