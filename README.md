# Excel Dashboard: Bank Loan Data Overview

I applied a bank loan dataset consisting of 38,576 records and 25 features to develop two dashboards. A one dashboard reveals a summary of the loan information such as good and bad loans, the amount funded and repayment. The other dashboard gives an overview, showing trends such as loan applications by month, purpose, state, term and employment length. These dashboards allow easy visualization of how loans are performing and customer trends in an easy to interpret manner.

The dashboard, known as Bank Loan Report | Summary, gives a breakdown of the performance of the loan and it displays a total of 38.6K applications, of which 86.18% are good loans (33.2K) and 13.82% are bad loans (5.3K). Good loans took 370.2M of the funded amount and 435.8M received whereas bad loans 65.5M of the funded amount and 37.3M received. The number of loans (32.1K) that have been completely paid , 5.3K are charged off, and 1.1K are current. Interest rates depend on the status with all paid loans at 11.64%, charged-off at 13.88%, and current at 15.10. The DTI ratios vary between 13.17 percent to 14.72 percent, which portrays the variance in the profile of the borrowers between loan types.

The dashboard is visually presented as a summary of 38.6K total loans applications funded and received (435.8M and 473.1M respectively), and a stable increase in loans per month. The interest rate is averagely 12.05% and the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is 13.33% on average. The term of most loans is 36 months (28.2K), and the vast majority of applicants are renters (18.4K) or do have a mortgage (17.2K). The most applications are in December (4.3K) and the largest category of employment is 10+ years (8.9K). The most common use of loans is debt consolidation (18.2K) and, geographically, the application volume is focused on the states of the East and South of the United States.
